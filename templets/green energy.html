    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <img src="https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/_1500x1500_fit_center-center_80/CEF_Shiloh-Temple_IMG_20180503_133709053_HDR_web.jpg" alt="Solar Project Image" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <p>
        Since our inception, we've been committed to delivering innovative solar solutions that empower a sustainable future. As a top solar panel manufacturer, we hold a significant market share across India, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our core products, <span class="highlight">Solar Water Heating Systems</span> and <span class="highlight">Photovoltaic Modules</span>, are crafted in our advanced Karnataka production units, ensuring premium quality and efficiency. We take pride in pioneering clean energy solutions that make a meaningful impact for communities and industries worldwide.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to build a platform that enables communities to invest in shared solar energy projects. The platform will allow users to buy shares in these projects and monitor their energy savings over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users will be able to track their contributions toward the solar energy initiative and display the corresponding energy produced by their investment. We support the overall communityâ€™s effort to adopt sustainable energy by providing easy access to investment opportunities in renewable energy projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the system will allow users to view their environmental impact, such as <span class="highlight">carbon savings</span> or equivalent reductions in <span class="highlight">greenhouse gas emissions</span>, based on their share in the solar energy project.
